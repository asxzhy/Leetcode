520. Detect Capital

Given a word, you need to judge whether the usage of capitals in it is right or not.

We define the usage of capitals in a word to be right when one of the following cases holds:

All letters in this word are capitals, like "USA".
All letters in this word are not capitals, like "leetcode".
Only the first letter in this word is capital, like "Google".
Otherwise, we define that this word doesn't use capitals in a right way.
 

Example 1:

Input: "USA"
Output: True
 

Example 2:

Input: "FlaG"
Output: False
 

Note: The input will be a non-empty word consisting of uppercase and lowercase latin letters.



====================================================================================================



Thougt: There are three possibilities. One is all lower cases, second one is first letter is upper case and the rests are lower cases, and the last one is all upper cases.
Therefore, we could check if the first letter's case. If the first letter is upper case, check for case changes after the second letter. If the first letter is lower cases,
all the rests have to be lower cases.
Code:Python
class Solution:
    def detectCapitalUse(self, word: str) -> bool:
        for i in range(1, len(word)):
            if word[0].isupper():
                if word[1].isupper() != word[i].isupper():  # check if the case changes after the first letter
                    return False
            else:
                if word[i].isupper():  # check if the case is upper if the first letter is upper case
                    return False
        return True



====================================================================================================



Thought: same as the previous solution
Code: python
class Solution:
    def detectCapitalUse(self, word: str) -> bool:
        a = True
        for i in range(1, len(word)):
            if word[i].isupper():
                a = False
        
        return word.isupper() or word.islower() or a



====================================================================================================



Thought: When the letters after the first letter are all lower case, it doesn't matter what case is for the first letter. We need to add a possibility for only one letter in the
input string since we are not checking the first letter when the word is not all capital
Code: Python
class Solution:
    def detectCapitalUse(self, word: str) -> bool:
        
        return word.isupper() or word[1:].islower() or len(word) < 2
